     ANDROID STUDIO JDK CONFIGURATION FIX
===========================================

ERROR: Invalid Gradle JDK configuration found.
The Gradle JVM is configured as #USE_PROJECT_JDK, but
the Project JDK is invalid or not defined.

SOLUTION STEPS:
===============

1. OPEN ANDROID STUDIO SETTINGS:
   File → Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → Build Tools → Gradle

2. CHANGE GRADLE JDK TO EMBEDDED:
   - Select "Gradle JDK": Choose "Embedded JDK (C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio2\jbr)"
   - Click "Apply" then "OK"
   - This uses Android Studio's built-in JDK that works with Gradle 8.5

3. REBUILD PROJECT:
   Build → Rebuild Project
   - Android Studio will sync Gradle automatically
   - All dependencies will download (~5-10 minutes first time)

4. VERIFY SDK LOCATION:
   File → Settings → System Settings → Android SDK
   - SDK location should be: C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio2\sdk
   - If different, update to match Android Studio's default

5. RUN THE APP:
   - Plugin install prompts may appear - accept them
   - Build → Make Project (should generate real APK)
   - Run → Run 'app' to test on device/emulator

EXPECTED BUILD PROCESS:
======================

TYPICAL FIRST BUILD TIME: 5-15 minutes
- Step 1: Gradle sync and dependency download
- Step 2: Native library compilation
- Step 3: APK generation

AFTER FIX, EXPECTED APK_sizes:
- Debug APK: ~25-30MB (with all PDF features)
- Release APK: ~20-25MB (optimized)

IF EMBEDDED JDK NOT FOUND:
==========================

Use Alternative JDK Paths:
1. First choice: Embedded JDK (recommended)
2. Second choice: Install JDK 17/18 from Oracle
3. Third choice: Use system JDK if JDK 8

SET JAVA_HOME REGISTRY:
Set Java home to the working JDK path.
